Approach 1: Prop-based Approach
Pros:

Explicit: Passing props makes the data flow explicit and easy to trace.
Reusable Components: Components are more reusable as they can be used independently with different sets of props.
Testing: Components are easier to test because you can directly test their behavior based on the provided props.
Cons:

Prop Drilling: If you have deeply nested components that need the same props, you may encounter prop drilling, where you pass props through multiple layers of components.
Approach 2: Child Components as Props
Pros:

Cleaner JSX: The JSX in the parent component can be cleaner as it only involves rendering child components.
Flexible Rendering: Allows for more flexibility in how child components are rendered or composed within the parent component.
Cons:

Implicit Data Flow: The data flow is less explicit, and it may be harder to trace where the props are coming from.
Limited Reusability: Child components are tightly coupled with the parent, which might limit their reusability in other contexts.
